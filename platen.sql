The band is noted for its impressive stage antics. Typically King Khan is scantily clad, and the overwhelming frontman. His performances feature cheerleader/go-go dancer Bamboorella and a mixture of instrumentation including, but not limited to: keyboard, baritone saxophone, guitar, bass, and drums.  Khan formerly played with fellow former Spaceshit member, Mark Sultan, in the King Khan &amp; BBQ Show, a doo-wop and punk inspired two-man band and is currently with Sultan and the Black Lips in a garage gospel super-group called Almighty Defenders. Sultan mentioned in 2010 that he and the Shrines have &quot;bandied about&quot; recording and singing some songs together.[1]  The original lineup of the (Sensational) Shrines consisted of King Khan on vocals and guitars, Mr. Speedfinger on guitar, Boom Boom Jennes on bass, John Boy Adonis on &quot;big beat,&quot; Sam Cook on trumpet, percussionist Ron (a.k.a. Rahn) Streeter (who formerly played for Ike and Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, and Al Jarreau), Ben Ra (the IT guy) on saxophone and Mr. Tom Bone on trombone. Eccentric French organist Fredovitch joined the lineup a week before the group recorded their first album at Toe Rag Studios in London.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Khan_and_the_Shrines','KNSqeIHynks',NULL),(2,'the king khan &amp; BBQ show','The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show is a Canadian Garage rock duo from Montreal, Quebec who mix doo-wop and punk. The band is composed of former Spaceshits bandmates Mark Sultan and Blacksnake, alias King Khan. Mark Sultan, under the pseudonym BBQ, contributed vocals, guitar, tambourine, bass drum, and snare drum, while King Khan provides lead guitar and vocals. An entertainer named Leo Chips, formerly known as Age of Danger of the Deadly Snakes, (the SHOW in King Khan &amp; BBQ Show) joined the group as a drummer and organist for some shows during the Invisible Girl U.S tour in 2009.[1]  Although the duo originally broke up in 2010, in 2011 they announced they had started recording together again and discussed the possibility of several new albums.[2] This was followed up with continued touring in 2012 and a return to normality for the band.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_Khan_%26_BBQ_Show',NULL,NULL),(3,'the tandoori knights','<table><tr><td>Genre</td><td>Bollybilly Rock...not really, but it\'s fun to say.</td></tr><tr><td>Leden band</td><td>King Khan &amp;amp; Bloodshot Bill</td></tr><tr><td>Geboorteplaats</td><td>Berlin/Montreal</td></tr><tr><td>Platenmaatschappij</td><td>Norton Records</td></tr><tr><td>Korte beschrijving</td><td>to make you sweat...</td></tr><tr><td>Lange beschrijving</td><td>Mood Music for slobs </td></tr><tr><td>Biografie</td><td>King Khan &amp;amp; Bloodshot Bill - Cookin\' from the same clay oven since 2009!</td></tr><tr><td>Huidige locatie</td><td>in a hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Interesses band</td><td>Eating, sweating, swearing, kissing (girls, not each other), cooking </td></tr><tr><td>Website</td><td><a href=&quot;www.bloodshotbill.com&quot;></a>bloodshotbill.com</td></tr><tr><td>Boekingsagent</td><td><a href=&quot;mailto:booksnribs@gmail.com&quot;>booksnribs@gmail.com</a></td></tr></table>','https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tandoori-Knights/160263867398604?sk=info&ref=page_internal',NULL,NULL),(4,'king khan','Khan was born in Montreal to an Indo-Canadian family. Since 2005 he resides in Berlin, Germany with his wife and two daughters.  King Khan was a member of a number of Canadian garage bands including the Spaceshits, a frantic garage punk outfit formed in mid-1995. As his circle of fellow trouble-maker musicians grew, in 1999 he helped create a &quot;death cult&quot; of such musicians, originally known as the &quot;Kukamongas&quot; with identifying tattoos and with plans including &quot;Jonestown, without the killing and Kool-Aid&quot;. He used the Blacksnake moniker while in the Spaceshits whose two full length albums were released on Sympathy for the Record Industry. He has spent a considerable amount of time in collaboration with former Spaceshits band-mate Mark Sultan in the two-man band, The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show. Since 1999 King Khan has performed as part of King Khan and the Shrines, a psychedelic soul nine member band. They signed to Vice Records in 2008. In early 2009 King Khan collaborated with Mark Sultan and the four members of the Black Lips to form a gospel supergroup called Almighty Defenders.
